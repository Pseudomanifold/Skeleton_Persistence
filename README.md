# Persistence Concepts for 2D Skeleton Evolution Analysis

This repository contains code & data for our publication &ldquo;[Persistence Concepts for 2D
Skeleton Evolution Analysis](http://bastian.rieck.ru/research/TopoInVis2017_Skeletons.pdf)&rdquo;,
which was accepted for the conference [*Topology-Based Methods in Visualization
2017*](http://fj.ics.keio.ac.jp/topoinvis).

At present, the code is rather unstructured. Expect additional instructions soon.
