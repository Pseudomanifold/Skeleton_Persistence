# Persistence Concepts for 2D Skeleton Evolution Analysis

This repository contains code & data for our publication &ldquo;Persistence Concepts for 2D Skeleton
Evolution Analysis&rdquo;, which was accepted for the conference [*Topology-Based Methods in
Visualization 2017*](http://fj.ics.keio.ac.jp/topoinvis).

At present, the code is rather unstructured. Expect additional instructions soon.
